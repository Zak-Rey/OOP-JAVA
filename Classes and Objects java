Classes are a blueprint of Objects.
Objects are instances of a class or classes.

Creating a class syntax:
      class ClassName {
      //fields-for data storage
      //methods-for performing operations
      }
      
Creating an Object syntax:

      className object = new className();
      
Fields and methods of a class can be accessed by an object by using the "." operator.

Objects can either be created in or outside the class, however, when creating them outside the class be sure to use the correct access modifier while creating the class.
