## **Java Singletone Class**

Singleton is a desing pattern that ensures only a single object can be created out of a class.

A class must implement the following to create a singleton pattern.

* Create a `private` constructor to restrict creation of objects outside the class.

* Create a `private` attribute of the class type that refers to the single object.

Create a `public static` method that will give access to creating and accessing the object created.
