# **OOP-JAVA**
##### Object-Oriented programming is a programming pradigm that focuses on the use of objects to represent and manipulate data. Java is a popular programming language that supports OOP concepts.

## **OOP concepts in java**

### ***Class***

*A **blueprint** for creating objects. It defines the attributes and behaviour that an object of that class will have. They are used to creating objects*

### ***Object***

*An object is an **instance** of a class. It is a real world entity that has state and behavior. Objects can interact with each other*

### ***Inheritance***

*A mechanism in which a new class is **derived from** an existing class.The new class inherits all the attribute s and behaviors of the existing class and can also add new attributes and behaviors.*

### ***Interface***

*A collection of **abstract methods** that define a **set of actions** that a **class can perform**. It provides a way to achieve abstraction and polymorphism in java.The are used to define the behaviour of classes without specifying how the behavior is implimented*

### ***Encapsulation***

*A practice of **hiding** the **implementation details** of an object and providing a public interface for accessing the objects attributes and behaviors. It is achieved by using access modifiers like private, protected, default, public*

### ***Polymorphism***

*Ability of an object to take **many forms**. It is achieved through **method overriding** and **method overloading**. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass, while method overloading allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.*
